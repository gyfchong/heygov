# Hey.GOV

hey.gov is a website that lets the community review and vote on public projects. 

Millions of people use rating and reviews websites every day to decide what to eat, where to live, and where to stay. 

We want people to be able to do the same with public projects. We feel it's important that you’re able to have your say in what's happening in your community.

The challenge was to design a system that leverages public attention, with the benefits being, ultimately a more engaged public and greater transparency. We’re encouraging people to add their voices to the mix, so there’s a better picture of where public support is for projects that are currently in place or proposed for the future. The goal here to have digitally driven social transparency, that the government is also able to respond to.
